**NOTE:** 
Unfortunately [deca.ca](http://deca.ca/) is currently in maintenance mode to prepare for the competitive season starting in November.   

## Home Page 
This is the landing page of Ontario DECA official website, [deca.ca](http://deca.ca/). This site is hosted on WordPress, the world's most popular website builder. 42% of the web (over 455 million sites ) is built on WordPress. WordPress runs on PHP and is paired with a MySQL database. 

Utilizing custom CSS and HTML scripts, I was able to give deca.ca a fresh coat of paint. As demoed below, I developed a dynamic navigation bar that transitions from a transparent background to a solid black as the user scrolls. Additionally I utilized HTML to structure all the text and elements below to provide a aesthically pleasing, simple viewing experience.
